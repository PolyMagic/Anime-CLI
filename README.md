# Anime-CLI

Hi I'm Placeholder

# Instalation

Install Node form nodejs.org (Version 10 is recommended)

Run this command it terminal.

```
npm i -g anime-cli
```

If you are on linux you need to use sudo for this command;

# Usage

Run

```
anime-cli
```

And again sadly anime-cli require sudo becouse of location of config files
It will be fixed in future (-:

# Small Notes

Current Dir option in anime-cli is same as your current location in terminall;

Anime Cli Dir is inside Global Node Modules Folder

```
On Windows: %appdata%/npm/node_modules/anime-cli
```
